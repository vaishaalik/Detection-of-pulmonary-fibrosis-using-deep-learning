# Detection-of-pulmonary-fibrosis-using-deep-learning
Pulmonary Fibrosis (PF) is a progressive disease isolated to the lung.PF is a form of interstitial lung disease, primarily involving the interstitium, and not directly affecting the airways or blood vessels. Since a cure for PF is not currently available, the goal is to reduce the rate of misdiagnosis. 

Links referred to get the datasets:

https://www.kaggle.com/c/osic-pulmonary-fibrosis-progression/overview- This Dataset contains PF CT scans.

https://www.kaggle.com/paultimothymooney/chest-xray-pneumonia- This Dataset contains Normal lung CT scans.

This project is on binary classification, made use of pulmonary fibrosis cases, normal cases images here.
Building of the basic classifier is complete. 

Ds-Creator.ipynb contains creation of the dataset & Final.ipynb contains the data preprocessing and traing of the cnn.
