Links referred to get the datasets:

https://www.kaggle.com/c/osic-pulmonary-fibrosis-progression/overview- This Dataset contains PF CT scans

https://www.kaggle.com/paultimothymooney/chest-xray-pneumonia- This Dataset contains Normal lung CT scans.

This project is on binary classification, made use of pulmonary fibrosis cases, normal cases images here.
Building of the basic classifier is complete. 

Ds-Creator.ipynb contains creation of the dataset & Final.ipynb contains the data preprocessing and traing of the cnn.
